Golang - Best Resources üéÅ

Golang is getting hugely popular üöÄ

As we are specifically working in Golang for the past 7-8 years, we got a chance to explore Golang in depth. While experimenting with its best features we got our fair share of learning what works well and what doesn‚Äôt.

Every day I get many messages from developers who are interested in learning Golang but don‚Äôt know what and how to learn.

Following are resources if follow rigorously, you‚Äôll get the best understanding of Golang which is most sought after by companies.

‚úÖ Basic Topics:- 
- You can start with Go Tour, which is developed by the Go team itself, you can simply check and run the main features of Go online and don‚Äôt need to install Go locally.
